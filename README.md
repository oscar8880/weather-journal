# Weather Journal
### A Web API and Asynchronous JS Project

For this project I created a web app which uses the Open Weather Map API to provide weather data for recording mood-based diary entries.

The key learning points were:
* Using Node and Express.js
* Dynamically updating the DOM
* Using external Web APIs
* Using promises and asynchronous JS
